One of the main challenges I faced during this project was getting the layout to match the design across both desktop and mobile screens. It took some trial and error to understand how Bootstrap’s flex utilities and spacing worked together for responsiveness. I approached these issues by breaking the layout into smaller sections and testing each change as I went. I found that bootstraps md design made it much simpler to lay out rows in mobile designs as well. I also used Bootstrap’s documentation a lot to simplify styling instead of relying on custom CSS. If I had more time, I’d focus on improving alignment consistency, refining spacing, and making the design look more polished overall.
